# Certain Reminder
A simple CLI tool that notifies you with manually set daily reminders. Implemented for people who needs a high level warning
that appears on top of every window to ensure that you don't miss :)

## How to Run
After installing the repository on your computer, 
- You can run `app.exe` found in this folder to run the program OR
- You can run `python startup_script.py` command on a terminal or a command prompt to have the app run every time you boot up

## Known Bugs
- Does not work as expected for the reminders that are set for the next day
- Currently the startup app feature only works in Windows 10

## TODOs
- Remove Python dependency for startup script
- Implement stand-alone GUI for convenience
